# -Student-Performance-Dashboard-Excel
This project explores how student performance is influenced by various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses.

## Overview
This is my **first Excel project**, where I built a dashboard to analyze **student performance** across multiple factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, and lunch type.

## Key Insights
- 85.6% students passed, 14.4% failed  
- Reading is the strongest subject, Math is the weakest  
- Higher parental education = better student scores  
- Standard lunch students perform better than free/reduced lunch students  
- Female students show slightly higher pass rates  

## Skills & Tools
- Data Cleaning  
- Pivot Tables  
- Slicers (for interactivity)
